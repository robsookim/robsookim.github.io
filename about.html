      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/self.png" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>My name is Robin Kim. I was born in Daegu, South Korea but moved to New York City when I 
        was 1 years old. I moved around a couple times but ended up setting in Bayside. I went to 
        Bronx High School of Science then to NYU Tandon School of Engineering for a Biomolecular Science
        degree.</p>

      <p> In the middle of degree, I ruined my back and ended up taking time off of class, where
        I decided to teach myself some basic code to pass the time. This was where I realized that 
        coding was what I truly wanted to continue with and not biology.</p>

      <p>I am currently working as an EMT
        and doing this Coding Boot Camp. I have one brother who is 7-8 years younger than me (depending)
        on the month, and a dog named Goolbi, who I love more than my parents or my brother.</p>
