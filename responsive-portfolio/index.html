          <p>My name is Robin Kim. I was born in Daegu, South Korea but moved to New York City when I 
              was 1 years old. I moved around a couple times but ended up setting in Bayside. I went to 
              Bronx High School of Science then to NYU Tandon School of Engineering for a Biomolecular Science
              degree.</p>
    
          <p>In the middle of degree, I ruined my back and ended up taking time off of class, where
              I decided to teach myself some basic code to pass the time. This was where I realized that 
              coding was what I truly wanted to continue with and not biology.</p>
    
          <p>I am currently working as an EMT and doing this Coding Boot Camp. I have one brother who is 7-8 years younger than me (depending)
              on the month, and a dog named Goolbi, who I love more than my parents or my brother.</p>
